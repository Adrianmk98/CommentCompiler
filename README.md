A person can enter a link to a reddit comment thread and recieve back what each user has commented. This can be helpful for moderation, but I have found it especially
useful when it comes to any grading that must be done from a reddit thread.

The Mark as Read button highlights any results as green so you are aware that they have already been checked.
Open in browser button allow the user to open the comment, allowing for the viewing of context and allowing for someone to be able to get a better grasp on the conversation.
